# Abstract

In the Philippines, recurrent typhoons and heavy rainfall frequently inundate low-lying communities such as the Municipality of Camaligan, where both urban and river flooding pose serious risks. To improve preparedness, this study developed a predictive fluvial flood mapping web application. The study's objectives included data preprocessing (historical rainfall and water level, and other relevant data), predictive model training, model evaluation, web application implementation, and system user evaluation. The modeling pipeline integrated a NARX neural network for time-series prediction, and QGIS and HEC-RAS for hydrodynamic simulation, all orchestrated by automation scripts. After iterative fine-tuning, the final model achieved an R² of 0.87, Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.87, RMSE of 0.178, and a prediction latency of 2.93 seconds. The web application was developed to showcase the flood extent maps, nearby critical facilities, and reports. User surveys indicated strong satisfaction, with 86.4% of respondents rating the system 4 or 5 out of 5 for usability and effectiveness. These results demonstrate the accuracy of the NARX algorithm while proving the feasibility of giving machine learning predictions spatial context through simulations for localized flood forecasting, offering an accurate and efficient tool for communities and responders to visualize and respond to flood threats.
