# Hi there, this is the Mathinik FLOWS Team ðŸ‘‹

**A short introduction**

We are a team formed for our final (yay!) thesis paper in our 4th year as Computer Science students at Bicol University. In today's date of writing this, we have already graduated! We are composed of two programmers and a writer in-charge for external relations.

**Where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?**

Our full thesis paper is uploaded in our repositories, including the codebase for the project. The repository is pretty messy we admit! The repository is just publicized for reference and for building our portfolios. The [flows_app](https://github.com/Mathinik-flows/flows-app) repository can be downloaded and run for you to try out a static version of our project. We appreciate it if we keep our code to ourselves <3

**Fun facts**

Why Mathinik? It was because of this [reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6vJejFPeKn/) . Just a meme name, nothing too deep. As for the name FLOWS, it stands for "Flood Observation Warning System".

## Abstract

In the Philippines, recurrent typhoons and heavy rainfall frequently inundate low-lying communities such as the Municipality of Camaligan, where both urban and river flooding pose serious risks. To improve preparedness, this study developed a predictive fluvial flood mapping web application. The study's objectives included data preprocessing (historical rainfall and water level, and other relevant data), predictive model training, model evaluation, web application implementation, and system user evaluation. The modeling pipeline integrated a NARX neural network for time-series prediction, and QGIS and HEC-RAS for hydrodynamic simulation, all orchestrated by automation scripts. After iterative fine-tuning, the final model achieved an RÂ² of 0.87, Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.87, RMSE of 0.178, and a prediction latency of 2.93 seconds. The web application was developed to showcase the flood extent maps, nearby critical facilities, and reports. User surveys indicated strong satisfaction, with 86.4% of respondents rating the system 4 or 5 out of 5 for usability and effectiveness. These results demonstrate the accuracy of the NARX algorithm while proving the feasibility of giving machine learning predictions spatial context through simulations for localized flood forecasting, offering an accurate and efficient tool for communities and responders to visualize and respond to flood threats.
